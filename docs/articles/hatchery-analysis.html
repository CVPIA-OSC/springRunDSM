<p>Temporal Range: 2010 - 2012</p>
<p>Most data were obtained from CWT (coded wire tag) analyses with limited data in 2010 from CVPIA ChinookProd Database Version 2, September 22, 2017. Data from these sources were compiled in a csv called <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv" class="external-link">hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment to Feather and Yuba Rivers:</strong></p>
<p>Feather and Yuba Rivers do not separate spring and fall run in totals. Here, we apply the proportion of spring hatchery return adults to adjust the totals for 2010 - 2012. Data used for Feather and Yuba adjustment were from <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/GrandTab.2017.04.07.pdf" class="external-link">GrandTab 2017 version.</a></p>
<p>The data table below shows the prepped data for analysis. (<code>No_hatch_returns</code> corresponds to the number of hatchery fish returning, <code>Hatch_flag</code> describes if fish are hatchery(1) or not hatchery(0))</p>
